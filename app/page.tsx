I build pragmatic, performant sites and apps.</p>
          <p className="lead mb-6">I worked in London for many years and relocated to the South Hams in 2019. I have a wealth of web experience and know that when it comes to ideas, boilerplate, one size fits all solutions don't always fit.</p>
          <p className="lead mb-6">I'm passionate about helping ventures grow and succeed online. Whether you need a new website, want to optimise an existing one, or have questions about a project, I'm here to help. </p>
