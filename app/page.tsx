I build pragmatic, performant sites and apps.</p>
        <p className="lead mb-6">I worked in London for many years and re-located to the South Hams in 2019. I have a wealth of web experience and know that when it comes to ideas and businesses, boilerplate, one size fits all solutions don't always fit.</p>
        <p className="lead mb-6">I'm passionate about helping businesses grow and succeed online. Let's work together to create something amazing.</p>
